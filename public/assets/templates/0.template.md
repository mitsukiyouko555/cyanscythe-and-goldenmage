If you accidentally commited a file that is too big, remove it with this and then recommit:

git filter-branch -f --tree-filter 'rm -f /path/to/file' HEAD --all

You can now add callouts and stuff like expandables like this!!

You can use headers here!!
<details>
<summary><h2>See Here</h2></summary>
  Sometimes with a root user, things might not work properly. So creating a new user with sudo permission is a better option.
</details>
