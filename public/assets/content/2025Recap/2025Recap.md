blurb: A list of all the stuff I did in 2025!
---

Having just moved from the US to Malaysia and started a new job, things were a bit hectic as I had a lot of imposter syndrome issues - but that aside, I think I have done a decent job this year, personal passion project wise and personal blog project wise.

I have a general schedule of somewhere between 1-4 hours after work on a daily basis and 4-8 hrs per weekend day so everything on this list is done during that time for a modest estimate (+ buffer) of +/-25 hrs a week.

### Recap:

I recently discovered Jibble and I've started using it to track how much time (roughly) I spend working on what - which is def good to know to see how fast I can complete animations or illustrations so I can gague how long it'd take me to work on the next item. I also went back and did an estimate of roughly how long I spent on each of the lil mini projects I did throughout the year.

Looks like I spent about 434 Hours Drawing this year!

![illustmetrics](assets/content/2025Recap/img/illustmetrics.png)

And 128 hours animating.. Not sure if I overestimated that time by a bit but I guess it seems about right..

![animmetrics](assets/content/2025Recap/img/animmetrics.png)

And 110 hours learning and working on 3D Modeling/Rigging/etc in Blender

![animmetrics](assets/content/2025Recap/img/3dmetrics.png)

And almost 104 hours Plotbuilding/Worldbuilding.

![animmetrics](assets/content/2025Recap/img/writingmetrics.png)

Projectwise, I mainly worked on Misc stuff, the Cyanscythe and Goldenmage Blog, and World/plotbuilding.

![animmetrics](assets/content/2025Recap/img/projoverview.png)

So I spent 922 hours and 30 minutes of my free time outside of work to work on all this so I feel like I've def done some stuff :D

Word count wise, I'm at 687K+ Words :D

![wordcount](assets/content/2025Recap/img/wordcount.png)

This year, H@\<K-wise, unexpectedly, was more of a merch year - which was quite good for me as it made me feel like my story is coming alive :D

And that's it for this year!

Thanks for reading - Lots more to come in 2026!
