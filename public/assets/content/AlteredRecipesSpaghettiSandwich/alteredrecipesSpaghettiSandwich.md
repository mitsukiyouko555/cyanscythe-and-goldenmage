### Overview

This (vegetarian) recipe was inspired by a spaghetti sandwich I had before at [Clover Bakery](https://www.cloverbakery.com/breads.html), which per their website, looks like this:

### Cookware/Eatery:

- 1x Plate
- 1 x Pan
- 1x Pot
- 1x Tongs/Chopsticks/whatever you use to take noodles out of the pot.
- 1x Spatula

### Ingredients:

Serving Size: 1

- Broccoli about 1 cup
- Mushroom (any kind) about 1 cup
- Tomatoes (Mid or large Sized 2x or about 1 cup)
- Spaghetti (1/2 serving for 1 person)
- 2 Large slices of Bread (Sourdough is nice) OR 1x subway sandwich style bread - the kind you put hotdogs in works nicely as well.
- Balsamic Vinegar - 1 tablespoon
- Olive Oil - 1 Tablespoon
- Spices: (Chili Powder, Salt, Pepper, Parsley, Basil)
- 1-2 slices of cheese or 1-2 sticks of cheese sticks or 1/2 cup of cheese. (optional but makes things taste way better)
- Butter (Optional)

### Instructions:

1. In a pot, boil some water, sprinkle a pinch of salt and cook the pasta til el dente or to your liking.
2. In a pan, add some butter or olive oil and pan fry the bread on both sides til golden/crisp or to your liking
3. Take the bread out of the pan and put it on a plate, one next to the other.
4. Pour a small amount (1/2 tablespoon) of olive oil and balsamic vinegar on each slice of bread (on the side facing up.)
5. Saute the Broccoli, Mushroom, and Tomatoes and stir it from time to time with the spatula while adding spices (Chili Powder, Salt, Pepper, Parsley, Basil, and whatever other spices you want to add).
6. If the vegetables are done before the Spaghetti, turn the heat down to low.
7. Once the spaghetti is done, use the tongs to take the spaghetti out and gently shake up and down to drip off any excess water and put the spaghetti into the pan.
8. Mix the spaghetti with the vegetables and it for a bit til the sauce soaks in - add more spices if needed.
9. Turn off the heat and use the tongs to place the spaghetti and vegetables onto the bread.
10. Enjoy! eat it like a subway sandwich or fold the bread in half or really, however you feel like eating it.


### Afterword

I would put a picture here......... but unfortunately I already ate it XD But it basically looks like what the Clover Bakery Pics look like except with more vegetables and with 2 slices of sourdough bread instead of 1 subway sandwich bread.
