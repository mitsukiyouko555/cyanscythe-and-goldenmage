Activate your holo\n\n![holo](assets/content/ConceptualTechnicalWriting-ObjectCompression/img/holo.png)\n\n2. Open the compression app\n\n![logoclick](assets/content/ConceptualTechnicalWriting-ObjectCompression/img/logoclick.png)\n\n3. Click scan and point your holo's camera towards the object. Once scanned, the item is linked and absorbed into your holo for compression purposes.\n    \n\t1. If multiple objects get scanned, select the object(s) you want to compress, ignoring those you don't\n\t2. If compressing multiple objects, see if you want to compress them all into one cube or if you want to compress them into individual cubes\n\t3. if you decide to cancel the compression, click cancel and your item will be released from the holo and be physically accessible again.\n4. Once the item(s) have been selected, select the compression size (customizable using a circle control)\n5. Select a compression shape (Cube, Sphere, Diamond, Custom, etc.)\n\t1. A cubed compression looks like this\n\t2. A Diamond Compression looks like this\n\t3. A Sphere Compression looks like this\n\t4. To create a custom compression shape, click Custom and a modeling tool will pop up.\n\t\t1. If you've saved custom shapes before, in the top right hand corner, click the hamburger menu and click \"saved shapes\". Otherwise, proceed with modeling a custom shape.\n\t\t\t1. You have the option of modeling it yourself from scratch\n\t\t\t2. Or prompting AI to create a shape for you.\n\t\t\t\t1. You can tell it how many variations to generate and select the ones you like\n\t\t\t\t2. You can also describe the use case for your compression (ie fits in a box shaped like this (with a diamond shaped mold/inset), etc.)\n\t\t2. If you want to model it yourself, \\<insert blender-like modeling directions here>\n\t\t3. Once you have modeled your custom shape, click save\n\t\t\t1. you can also save the shape as a template for future use\n6. Click \"compress\"\n7. A compression status circle will show in real time as it compresses.\n8. Once compressed, the status will show as complete\n9. You can choose one of these Security options\n\t1. Unsecured\n\t\t1. Anyone who wants to uncompress it can do so\n\t2. Password\n\t\t1. a window will pop up for you to put in a password\n\t\t2. the item can only be uncompressed by whoever puts in the right password\n\t3. Fingerprint\n\t\t1. a window will pop up on your holo's keyboard panel (your keyboard will be replaced with a fingerprint scanner for all 10 fingers) to scan your fingerprints\n\t4. Soul Print\n\t\t1. Only users with the soul print of the holo (aka only the user who compressed it can uncompress it)\n\t\t2. a secret key is generated in the background and stored on the compressed item(s)\n10. Click Export and The holo will present the compressed item to you (it comes out of the holo, between the user and the holo.)\n\t1. on opposite sides of the item, there is a half circle. so long as those remain as is, the item will remain compressed\n\n### How to Decompress Objects\n\n1. To Decompress, it depends on the level of security that was chosen during the compression process.\n\t1. Unsecured\n\t\t1. Anyone can decompress it\n\t2. Password\n\t\t1. Enter the password and only then will you be given access to decompress it\n\t3. Fingerprint\n\t\t1. the item itself produces ITS OWN holo of which scans your fingerprints. If it matches, it allows you to decompress\n\t4. Soul print\n\t\t1. the item connects its holo to your holo in the background and if their keys match, you are allowed to decompress it\n2. The actual decompression process is quite simple. take the item and twist it til the 2 half circles form a full circle and it will decompress back into the item's original size.\n3. To recompress an item, follow the compression steps again.","folderName":"ConceptualTechnicalWriting-ObjectCompression"},{"id":2,"title":"Changing the Line Width on a Raster Layer (CSP)","author":"Mitsuki Youko","date_created":"2025-11-15","tag":"techwriting","blurb":"A short blogpost detailing how to change the line width on a raster layer in Clip Studio Paint.","content":"\nExample use case:\n\nThis line here is too thick but I don't want to redraw it:\n\n![alt text](assets/content/HowToAdjustLineWidthonRasterLayerCSP/img/image-1.png)\n\n\"Why not use a vector layer?\" you might ask.

Why not mash that and what I learn in Ethical Hacking together?\nThat gave me the idea of drawing infographics whenever I learned something that could be infographic-worthy.\n \nSince I needed a name for my blog I just randomly came up with the word CyanScythe and created a character based off of that which I thought would be cool as an attacker type character. Then I thought \"Well attacker = red team.. so I'll need a \"defender\" and so I created GoldenMage.\n\n​\nIssue was that their color schemes were that of the opposing team.. but CyanScythe was such a cool name that I decided to make it so that she has magenta eyes and when she \"attacks\" with her scythe, it will turn red - thus giving her a red team vibe, despite the fact that her color scheme was cyan.\n \nDesign-wise, GoldenMage was a bit easier though I originally imagined his color scheme to be red and gold but since he is on the blue team, I gave him blue accessories. His powers are also blue to give off the blue team vibe.\n​\n\nNot only that, but a good theme here is that their designs can represent how important it is for red teamers to learn how to defend against cyber attacks and blue teamers to learn how attackers would attack, forming a good purple team - since they have colors of the opposing team.\n​\nIn the CyanScythe and GoldenMage Infographics, Cy will be presenting things from a Red Team Perspective while Den will be presenting things from a Blue Team Perspective.\n\nYou may also see a few comics about the both of them, if I happen to have a topic that can effectively be told in comic format.\n\nHope you enjoy the blog!\n\n---\n\n#### Cy's Character and Weapon Designs:\n\nWhen in Neutral mode, Cy's scythe is blue but it turns red when she is attacking.\n\n![Cy Neutral Mode](assets/content/IntroCyAndDen/img/Cy%20Neutral%20Mode.jpg)\n![Cy Attacker Mode](assets/content/IntroCyAndDen/img/Cy%20Attacker%20Mode.jpg)\n\n#### Den's Character and Weapons Design:\n\nDen's Barriers are not just for defensive purposes - he can use them to attack as well!\n\n![Den](assets/content/IntroCyAndDen/img/Den.jpg)\n![Den Weapon Design](assets/content/IntroCyAndDen/img/Den%20Weapons%20Design.png)\n","folderName":"IntroCyAndDen"},{"id":4,"title":"Pi Hole DNS Script","author":"Mitsuki Youko","date_created":"2025-04-19","tag":"scripts","blurb":"A Script to point your Linux Desktops to your Raspberry Pi's Pi Hole.","content":"\n## Note: This script assumes you have a Raspberry Pi and that you have Pi Hole Set up on your Raspberry Pi Already.\n\nThis script ensures that your Linux Desktop is pointed at your Pi Hole for DNS.\n\nIf you anticipate running this script for multiple machines, I would recommend deploying it via something like Ansible/Salt/Puppet or some other automation of that nature.\n\n[Here](https://github.com/mitsukiyouko555/saltstack), I used Saltstack to deploy it to my VMs.\n\nThis does not appear to work on Ubuntu SERVERS but it does work on Ubuntu Desktop, as well as Kali Linux.\n\nThe reason it does not work on Ubuntu servers is due to the difference in syntax when getting the connection name to show up.\n\n![PiDnsScript](assets/content/PiDnsScript/img/script.png)\n\n\n## Line By Line Breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### 1. #!/bin/bash\n\n^ This is what is known as the Shebang.

I'm a hobbyist so take my critique with however many grains of salt you'd like.\n\nNote: There are some large gifs and images in this Blogpost. If an image/gif looks like it's not loading, try refreshing the page and it should pop up...\n\nHere are my initial thoughts on it:\n\n1. Dog's eyes are too static, introduce some blink\n2. Belly flops around a bit toooo much.. its like his ribs are moving - seems slightly unnatural.. If he just has a fat belly, the flop should be lower. (imo)\n3. Legs are good but not quite on the ground\n4. No shadow\n5. Cloud moving in different directions.. i guess that kinda works but if there's wind thats impacting the clouds that much, the trees would be affected a little too..\n6. Ears, tail, and legs are actually quite good!\n7. Tongue looks like its being swung forward.. doesn't quite match the running direction...\n8. Tail is decent but it gets a little bit longer near the end.. (I struggle with that sometimes when I animate hair XD)\n9. Weight looks like it is on all 4 legs at the same time... I feel that when landing, weight should be on the front legs... this can probs be fixed simply by transforming and tilting the whole dog snout-side down just a tiny bit...\n10. Neck wrinkles are good but slightly off on timing it feels like..\n11. Looks like the path/ground is going z-axis yet the dog is running x axis which looks a bit.. strange i guess? but that might just be the placement cuz its not moving.. if the floor is moving, it would sell the thing a bit more...\n12. Imo the reason why it doesn't loop well is cus you probs need one more frame for some of the poses like the jump between the last and first frame is too big.\n13. Lighting.. The lighting changes too quickly on the dog like its running past a spotlight.. if its sunlight because its so far away, it wouldn't move on the dog that fast.\n14. Camera movement (maybe when landing, camera should follow the land a little - not TOO drastically but just a little movement helps)\n15. When looping always think back to HOW it loops. Do sketches first to see if it loops properly.. (before coloring or linearting). One trick is on the second half of the loop, use the frames in the first half in reversed order, then change some stuff in each so it doesn't just look like a copy\n\n---\n\n### Small Project Break Down..\n\n#### Animation Layers:\n1. Dog\n2. Shadow\n3. Foreground (Grass)\n4. Midground(ground and trees)\n    1. Make the ground long so that it you can move it x-axis. \n5. Background (clouds and mountains)\n6. Sky\n\n#### My Workflow for this critique demo:\n1. Sketch the dog running\n2. Sketch the dog's shadow\n3. Sketch the long bg on a different document. if animating, then composite it later. \n4. Lineart the bg\n5. Color the bg\n6. Lineart the dog\n7. Color the dog\n8. Color the Shadow\n9. Composite (Either baked in or after export.)\n\n#### I'll be making Two versions:\n1. Dog running with animated bg (BAKED IN Compositing)\n2. Dog running with animated bg (Compositing after Exporting)\n\n#### Composting tips:\n1. Export EACH animation layer separately so as to be able to add effects to them.. by layers I don't mean the dog's legs being on a different layer than its eyes... I mean Dog and its sublayers get exported as 1 png animation, the grass get exported as its own animation etc.. Anything you need to composite separately gets exported as its own png gif or image sequence.\n\n---\n\n### DEMO\n\nSo First thing's first.. gotta lay down the rough sketch of the dog model since its so long since I've drawn a dog.. (Had to rewatch the animal anatomy part of Marc Brunet's Digital Art School course that I bought a few years ago XD)\n\n![runningdogmodel](assets/content/RunningDog/img/Runningdogmodel.jpg)\n\nI used the straight line tool in CSP to make the line for the floor.\n\nThis is to make sure that when animating, the dog's paws won't go too high above or too low below the \"floor\". ideally it should land right on the line or as close to it as possible.\n\nI sketched the dog model just for reference and so I can make sure the animation stays on character.\n\nNow, so far drew a box around the dog so i can roughly tell where things are going to be placed...\n\n![dog-rectangle](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dog-rectangle.jpg)\n\nAnd then I animated the box to get the movement down..\n\n![blockout.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/blockout.gif)\n\n![roughplacement](assets/content/RunningDog/img/roughplacement.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, the frames are evenly spread out.. not very dynamic is it..?\n\nDon't worry, I will adjust the timing now after the rough movement has been placed..\n\nHere, I tend to play around - extend some frames, shorten others.. some people animate on 2's, 3's, 4's... that's way too much math for me loooll\n\nI animate based on feel.. so if you want to animate industry level stuff you might have to study how to animate on 2's etc. or whatever the industry uses :P\n\nI'm just a hobbyist and if it looks good to me, well that's really all I need XD\n\nSo after some re-timing, the frames now look like this:\n\n![frames_updated](assets/content/RunningDog/img/frames_updated.jpg)\n\nI also slightly adjusted the position and rotation of a few of the rectangles for a smoother flow..\n\n![blockout_framed](assets/content/RunningDog/img/blockout_framed.gif)\n\nSo the next phase of my rough sketch is going to be to move the bg around..\n\nWatch this excellent video on how to use Keyframes for Camera Movement in CSP:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8F9eJjDkvtE?si=l5YfQy6QEYK4ZD_p\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nIf you don't use CSP, you can try to see if the software you use supports camera movements.\n\nOtherwise, if you want to do your camera movements during compositing instead, make sure you make the canvas size like roughly 0.5-1 inches bigger so that when compositing, your bg won't get awkwardly cut off when you reach the edge of the canvas.\n\nHere, I have the background animation folders within a larger folder and applied the keyframes to said folder.\n\nThe rectangle \"dog\" was outside the \"camera\" folder so as to not be affected by the camera keyframes.\n\nBackground camera keyframed to ever-so-slightly move up and down upon impact.\n\n![camera_keyframe](assets/content/RunningDog/img/camerakeyframe.jpg)\n\n![camera_keyframe_gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/camera-keyframe.gif)\n\nThis is suuuuuper rough (bg timing is not very good either and should be fixed..).. Let's make this better and start sketching the dog :D\n\n![doglayer](assets/content/RunningDog/img/doglayer.jpg)\n\nImma start with the head..\n\n![dogheadske](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogheadske.gif)\n\nWhen the dog lands, it'll crouch a bit so the head will be lower than it is now on those frames but for now, lets get the general movement down before worrying about that.\n\nAdding the neck guidelines / sketch:\n\n![dogheadneck](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogheadneck.gif)\n\nAdding the body (mainly rib placement atm)\n\n![dogheadneckbod](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogheadneckbod.gif)\n\nAdding the tail.. this one was a bit complicated.. had to fiddle with it for a bit..\n\n![dogtail](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogtail.gif)\n\nOMG.. dogs are hard to draw lmaooo (not rly I just need more practice to get good at it XD)\n\nLooked up a dog running gif on the internet for some reference..\n\nOk.. I think Imma just stylize the legs instead of making them look realistic.. maybe gonna give him \"hoof-like\" legs instead cuz I'm too lazy to learn how to draw a dog just for this one critique XD\n\n![doglegz](assets/content/RunningDog/img/doglegz.gif)\n\nAight, added the ears and snout..\n\n![runningdogskebgless](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogskebgless.gif)\n\nChecking how it looks with the bg:\n\n![runningdogfullske](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogfullske.gif)\n\nPretty good so far..\n\nI decided that it would be easier to just draw the dog lineart on a different animation layer than the sketch just in case I add more in betweens so made another layer for lineart.\n\n![dognewlayer](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dognewlayer.jpg)\n\nI will most likely color in the same animation layer (not same layer as the lineart but think of EACH frame in the animation layer as a folder and within that folder there are many more layers like lineart, color, etc.)\n\nSwitching gears, I decided to work on the background and created a new 1920 x 1080 CSP file. I then changed the canvas size so as to make it super long horizontally so as to make a revolving background. remember that the rightmost and leftmost section of your bg would need to be \"connectable\" with each other to sell that continuous effect when looping.\n\nI also expanded the canvas slightly vertically so as to maintain enough space for the camera's slight vertical pan when the dog jumps.\n\n![bgdoc](assets/content/RunningDog/img/bgdoc.jpg)\n\nI started with the clouds. \n\n![cloudline](assets/content/RunningDog/img/cloudline.jpg)\n\nI don't think there is wind strong enough to really make the clouds move drastically in any direction without it blowing the dog away (Clouds usually move rather slowly.. so unless the camera is focused on the clouds, you probs won't see it move much if at all.) so I'll keep the clouds static and have it wrap around in a revolving loop later.\n\n![cloudske](assets/content/RunningDog/img/cloudske.jpg)\n\nWhat I mean by revolve is if you take the right and leftmost cloud and you put them together, they should line up perfectly...\n\n![cloudwrap](assets/content/RunningDog/img/cloudwrap.jpg)\n\nThis is so that when you pan, you start with lining up the right side of this image to the right edge of the dog anim, and then you pan it by dragging it to the right slowly and smoothly. By the time it reaches the right side, there is no more art to continue it, you wrap it around and keyframe the image from its starting position coming in from the left..\n\nIt'll probably make more sense to see it in action so here's a video I made... (Keep in mind this is still quite rough... but it gets the point across..)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0TCPKRYMY8?si=BFuFJLrWPrSQyyHu\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nMoving on, I added some \"mountains\" in the bg as well as some bushes.\n\n(Ignore the bad bush/nature art XD I'm just half assing the bg rn since this critique is mainly about making the bg feel like it is moving properly and making the whole thing feel like its moving cohesively.)\n\nI then added some (badly drawn) grass that is supposed to go in front of the dog and the bushes. I'll animate the grass for maybe like 3-4 frames for a quick gentle sway, color it, then copy and paste it across the screen.\n\n![grass](assets/content/RunningDog/img/grass.jpg)\n\nThe dog's animation layer will go between the grass and the bushes.\n\nSo the grass will cover the dog when they overlap and the dog will cover the bushes when they overlap.\n\nAdditionally, this is the order of animation layers from moving the fastest to slowest in terms of panning:\n\n1. Grass (Fast when compared to the others but not SUPER fast either..)\n2. Dog (about the same speed as the grass)\n3. Ground/Bushes (slower than the dog)\n4. Mountains (slower than the bushes)\n5. Clouds (the slowest)\n\nHere is the badly animated grass (Ok enough for the critique tutorial.. def not up to par for my personal work tho lol)\n\n![badgrassanim](assets/content/RunningDog/img/badgrassanim.gif)\n\nHere it is colored:\n\n![grasscolored](assets/content/RunningDog/img/grasscolored.gif)\n\nHere it is with the grass strewn across the page.\n\n![grassfullanim](assets/content/RunningDog/img/grassfullanim.gif)\n\nAnd because we are only seeing parts of it at a time, it won't seem too repetitive.. otherwise ideally one should draw different strands of grass throughout at least half of it or draw a few chunks of grass and mix up the order for variety - but even like this it seems alright.. (if you don't look too closely)\n\nI had the grass in a different file so I straight up copied the grass animation folder into the running dog csp file.\n\nI have the already animated grass layer above the dog running layer and keygramed the grass layer like so:\n\n![dogAndGrassKeyframe](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogAndGrassKeyframe.jpg)\n\nAnd now it looks like this:\n\n![dogAndGrass](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogAndGrass.gif)\n\nThis is rough.. but will probs refine it later.\n\nColored and \"animated\" the clouds via transform and keyframes.\n\nNote - this is one of the reasons why I prefer to NOT bake in my composite...\n\nAs you can see, the clouds are basically forced to move at the same speed as the grass and it looks unnatural.. This is because the rest of the animation is within the 27 frames I have here. If I were to expand the number of frames, the dog and grass would be empty or the cutoff would be weird.\n\nBUT when compositing/video editing after exporting it out, you have a LOT more control over the individual elements and how fast or slow they move.\n\nYou can have the clouds move much slower and just keep looping the dog and the grass via copy and paste once you have the first loop down and make the duration long enough to cover the duration of the clouds. Or if it somehow never matches up, you can still do a few loops and then do a slow fade out so it doesn't look awkward. (I will demo that later)\n\n![mehclouds.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/mehclouds.gif)\n\n![mehclouds.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/MehClouds.jpg)\n\nAdded the bg and the ground.. though as you can see, if the ground is static, it would look very strange and out of place as everything else is moving.\n\n![runningdogstaticfloor.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogstaticfloor.gif)\n\n![runningdogmovingfloor.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogmovingfloor.gif)\n\nNot sure why the bg is so choppy like that.. but we can probs fix that in compositing.. I think that's part of why I prefer exporting and then compositing it otherwise you get weird artifacts like this. (Could be a CSP thing though.. not sure actually...)\n\nIn any case, as you can see, the floor being moved along like a treadmill adds to the movement.\n\nThe clouds really bother me tho.. can't wait to fix them when I composite XD\n\nMoving on.. I fininshed the floor and the bushes and ended up putting them on the same layer.. I like how it came out.\n\nHere is a PNG of it.\n\n![bushesAndGround.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/bushesAndGround.png)\n\nI don't like the mountains tho.. but that's cus I didn't try too hard since I have other projects to work on and this project was taking longer than anticipated XD But it's been fun!\n\n![mountains.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/mountains.png)\n\nAs I was experimenting, I found that layering the mountains and having the layers move at different speeds (further ones moving slower, closer ones moving faster) makes it look better.\n\n![runningDogWithBg.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogWithBg.gif)\n\nHowever, I still don't like how hard it is to time everything (when you have a lot of moving pieces like this) all within CSP. This would be much easier to do with say, Da Vinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, or some kind of video editor so that everything can have a different speed.\n\nRandom note: I shaded the grass a little but but because of how I did the keyframes, its too much work to implement it into the csp ver so I will use it in the Compositing ver.\n\nFor now, just know that the grass now looks like this:\n\n![shadedGrass.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/shadedGrass.png)\n\nThough you probably can't tell from far away. (But don't worry, it'll be enlarged during the compositing phase.)\n\n![shadedGrass.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/shadedGrass.gif)\n\nSo now my background layers are all done (though in a real project I would add a lot more shading first) and consists of the following Layers (ordered by furthest to closest):\n\n1. Sky\n\n![sky.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/sky.jpg)\n\n2. Clouds\n\n![clouds.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/clouds.png)\n\n3. Mountains\n\n![mountains.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/mountains.png)\n\n4. Ground / Bushes\n\n![bushesAndGround.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/bushesAndGround.png)\n\n5. Grass\n\n![GrassNoBg.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/GrassNoBg.gif)\n\nAs you can see, only the Grass is actually animated.. the rest are all \"animated\" by literally transforming and moving the images around.\n\nNow, back to the badly drawn dog (didn't use references for most of it thats why).... \n\nYes.. Yes, I know, there are many things wrong with this dog animation (since I'm not really trying very hard with this dog...)\n\nAight.. here's the lineart of the dog:\n\n![runningdoglineart.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdoglineart.gif)\n\nAnd here is the lineart with the shadow (also roughly done...):\n\n![runningdogwithshadow.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogwithshadow.gif)\n\nHere, I like to do a rough check of the lineart by watching it loop while focusing on different parts of the animation.\n\nWatch the loop and focus on just the tail and check if it looks ok.\nThen observe just the back legs, then just the front legs, then just the torso, then just the eyes, then just the tongue, and.. you get the idea..\n\nBy only observing PARTS of the animation at once, it helps you better spot the looping errors - especially if part of the animation seems to not be very smooth but you can't figure out exactly where. (For example, the fur on the nape of the dog's neck appears and disappears too suddenly. I should probably add a few more frames where the fur eases in and out for better flow.)\n\nExample: \n\nFocusing on the Ears:\n\n![Ears.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/Ears.gif)\n\nTongue:\n\n![Tongue.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/Tongue.gif)\n\nForelegs:\n\n![Forelegs.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/Forelegs.gif)\n\nBack Legs:\n\n![BackLegs.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/BackLegs.gif)\n\nTail:\n\n![Tail.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/Tail.gif)\n\nAdded some gentle/light baked in comp.. \n\nJust a tiny bit of atmospheric lighting + contrast on top of everything.\n\n![bakedInComp.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/bakedInComp.jpg)\n\nHere is what it looks like without the baked in comp:\n\n![runningDogNoComp.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogNoComp.gif)\n\nAnd here is what it looks like with the comp:\n\n![runningDogBakedInComp.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogBakedInComp.gif)\n\nAs you can see, the gradient lighting and added contrast gives it more depth.\n\nNow, I could go further and add and lighting shading on everything individually (and most of the time I do but I'll leave it like this for this one since its not a serious project...)\n\nLaid down some color flats. (Orig I made the dog darker but the value was too close to the bg so I made him a lighter gray.)\n\n![runningDogFlats.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogFlats.gif)\n\nThe background still seemed too flat so I added a bit more comp for the baked in version with different gradients clipped onto the different layers of bg using different blending modes like so:\n\n![moreComp.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/moreComp.jpg)\n\nDid a value check and it looks alright... In a more serious project I would pay a lot more attention to making the values contrast a lot more.. But since this is not the focus of this critique.. I'll settle with this for now.\n\n![runningdogValueCheck.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogValueCheck.gif)\n\nAnd Here's the colored ver.. Adding all that comp makes it look a lot more vibrant and less flat imo.\n\n![runningDogMoreComp.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogMoreComp.gif)\n\nOne thing I noticed is - if you want the clouds to be directly above the dog, then there will also need to be shadows for the clouds on the floor and the dog.\n\nBut I want it to be more in the bg so will probably do some kind of blur on it later so its not quite as sharp. Otherwise everything looks more or less about the same distance due to everything having such sharp lineart/color.. But I can't do that in CSP (as far as I know) since the blur effect only affects singular layers not folders. \n\nThat would be another good reason to comp things in a video editor so you can have more control over stuff like that.\n\nOk! Finally finished coloring the dog:\n\n![runningDogFullColor.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogFullColor.gif)\n\nAnd added some more comp just cus it didn't look quite right.. I dimmed the bg/mountains just a bit just so you can see the dog better.\n\n![andSomeMoreComp.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/andSomeMoreComp.jpg)\n\nHonestly still doesn't look quite right.. but its ok we are going to make it better during composting in this next section!\n\n![runningdogWithBakedInComp.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogWithBakedInComp.gif)\n\n---\n\n### Compositing in Da Vinci Resolve\n\nActually, the reason why I wanted to do this critique/tutorial was cuz I wanted to get back into animating after not having done any serious animation for like 1.5 years, AND also because I wanted to learn how to composite better in Da Vinci Resolve.\n\nSo for this part, we are sort of going to be learning together!\n\nNote: You don't have to use Da Vinci Resolve if you already have a video editor you like to use. Compositing concepts are probably going to be roughly the same.\n\nIn Da Vinci, most of the fancy stuff is done in Fusion.\n\nFusion uses a thing called nodes.\n\nThis is the video that helped me figure out, a few years back, how to actually use nodes in fusion. The only one that really made a lot of sense to me and made things click. (Though this is an updated video the content is more or less the same.)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PoinMs_YceQ?si=WD21TBAGAjaO5SqH\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nSo first, I'm going to export my backgrounds, uncomp'd!\n\nBy that I mean do it one background item at a time (one for the mountain, one for the ground/trees, one for the clouds, one for the grass.)\n\nSo its not going to be one lump of all the backgrounds together. Going to need each item separately so we can apply different comps to each of the different items.\n\nI also exported the dog without the shadow as a png sequence, and exported just the shadow as a separate png sequence so in case we want to do something fancy with just the dog or just the shadow, they are not bound to each other.\n\nThe grass is also a png sequence.\n\nSo my files look like this:\n\n![compFiles.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/compFiles.jpg)\n\n![dogCompFiles.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogCompFiles.jpg)\n\n![dogShadowCompFiles.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/dogShadowCompFiles.jpg)\n\nIn Da Vinci Resolve, I started a new project and went to the Edit tab\n\n![editTab.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/editTab.jpg)\n\nThen I imported all my assets:\n\n![importedAssets.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/importedAssets.jpg)\n\nI moved the Dog onto the timeline, made a new track and moved the shadow below the dog, lining them up.\n\n![timelineDogShadow.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/timelineDogShadow.jpg)\n\nThat looks like this in the viewport.\n\n![viewportDogShadow.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/viewportDogShadow.jpg)\n\nThis is a very basic set up but before we get into the fancy stuff, I'm going to watch a refresher video.\n\nAt the bottom of this post, I linked some tutorials on how to use Da Vinci Resolve if this is your first time.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtKhezId7As?si=p2WGkntUlgb2a6K7\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nOk so after watching that tut, I have a better idea of how I want to composite this.\n\n![comp-setup.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/comp-setup.png)\n\nWhat I would like to do though is also add a lightning effect so its like the sun is coming from the right side... but with all these being separate clips and they are all animated at different speeds, puting them in one clip would not be very flexible... I remembered there is a way to add something on top of everything else by making a new fusion composition.\n\nSo I right clicked in the media pool and clicked New Fusion Compositon:\n\n![addFusionComp.png](assets/content/RunningDog/img/addFusionComp.png)\n\nClicked Create:\n\n![newFusionComp.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/newFusionComp.jpg)\n\nThen dragged the new fusion composition into the timeline ABOVE everything else, as the lighting should be above all the layers.\n\n![moveFusionComp.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/moveFusionComp.jpg)\n\nOp and now there is a warning that there is no frame available for media out. What that means is basically the only node in there is media out and you need to have something for it to output.\n\n![FusionCompWarning.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/FusionCompWarning.jpg)\n\nSo with the Fusion Composition clip selected, I went to the Fusion Tab:\n\n![GoToFusionTab.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/GoToFusionTab.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, there is just one lonely Media Out node all by its lonesome...\n\n![lonelyMediaOut.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/lonelyMediaOut.jpg)\n\nLet's add a background as a placeholder for now. We can change it later.\n\nClick near the media out node and then click Command (Mac) or CTRL (Windows) + Spacebar.\n\nThat should bring up a Select tool.\n\nType in bg and add the Background\n\n![cmdCtrlSpace.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/cmdCtrlSpace.jpg)\n\nNow you will see the background and media out nodes.\n\n![connectBgMediaOut.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/connectBgMediaOut.jpg)\n\nConnect them like so:\n\n![BgMOConnected.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/BgMOConnected.jpg)\n\nNow go back to the edit/timeline page and you will notice that the error is now gone.\n\n![NoMoreWarning.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/NoMoreWarning.jpg)\n\nAs the background by default is black (you can change the color but this is just a placeholder for now), if you lower the opacity you can still see the stuff under it, affecting ALL the layers, thus confirming that it is doing what we want it to do.\n\n![OpacityCheck.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/OpacityCheck.jpg)\n\nNow, back to the fusion tab, I clicked on the background and changed the type from Solid to Gradient. For now, I selected some kind of yellow for the rightmost color:\n\n![BGgradient.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/BGgradient.jpg) \n\nNow, when it comes to the leftmost one, you might wonder why there are no colors for you to select like the one on the right. No worries, just drag the color bar from black to white:\n\n![BGgradient2.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/BGgradient2.jpg) \n\nNow, you will have the full array of colors to select from. I opted for a cyan-ish color for now... just to see how it looks.\n\n![gradientCyan.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/gradientCyan.jpg)\n\nI also added a color in the middle by clicking that position, and put it at a pastel yellow, closer to white. then lowered the alpha a bit to make it sort of transparent since I don't want the middle to stand out that much.\n\n![lowerAlpha.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/lowerAlpha.jpg)\n\nNow, going back to the EDIT Tab, on the right side, I fiddled with it and decided to change composite mode to Divide.. You should toggle through all the settings under composite mode and see which one works best for you.\n\nI also lowered the opacity for it as well..\n\n![Divide.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/Divide.jpg) \n\nSince Divide made it so the left side is pink and the right side is blue, I used the flip button to flip it around so that the right side is pink and the left side is blue.\n\n![Flip.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/Flip.jpg) \n\nFiddled around and added another gradient color for transition:\n\n![moreGradient.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/moreGradient.jpg)\n\nAfter fiddling some more, I felt that it looked better with Opacity at or near 100% so I set it back to 100% for now...\n\n![overview.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/overview.jpg) \n\nNow, if you are familiar with Da Vinci, you might be wondering... why aren't you using the color tab for these color corrections?\n\n(For those that aren't familiar, the color tab is super cool - I linked some videos at the very bottom of the blogpost so make sure to check em out!)\n\nThe reason I'm not using the color tab at the moment is because right now I have a bunch of layered clips and if you want to color grade EVERYTHING TOGETHER, it needs to be one clip.. Otherwise it'd be the same as doing everything individually which defeats the point for what I'm trying to do here BUT once everything is set up and composited and the loops are set as I'd like, I can create a composite clip that basically turns all the layers into ONE singular clip.\n\nPersonally, it is at THAT point that I would use the color tab for the finishing touches. So for now, that Fusion Comp Gradient Layer I'm putting on top is more or less a placeholder for now. If I like it I'll keep it but I'll probs be making more color grading touches in the Color tab.\n\n![colorTab.jpg](assets/content/RunningDog/img/colorTab.jpg) \n\nOne thing I was concerned about is whether or not a shorter clip can keep looping while the fusion clip was longer.. and I found out that yes, it can!!\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vs08wbx5t3c?si=0n4z-SpmvibSKNg1\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nFrom here on out, I'll just record my process as writing down what I'm doing step by step takes too long. \n\nI ended up deleting that one fusion layer I had on top of everything else since I fiddled with making a new fusion layer and putting ALL the images and clips into one fusion layer but the issue was that I needed to be able to move the background and foreground up and down when the dog landed on impact but it was hard to do with the nodes as the dog sat between the grass and the background thus if I moved the background and the foreground, the dog would also move - so I ended up breaking it out.\n\nIf you want to skip my fiddling around, jump to the 10 minute mark in the video.\n\nSo while putting everything into one fusion layer is a good technique it doesn't quite work out for me in this case. You may run into stuff like this when you composite too, but just roll with it and have fun and make tweaks and changes where needed!\n\nHere is the full timelapse of my 7.5 hours of compositing but sped up 700+% so that it's only 1 hour long. Feel free to slow down the vid on youtube.\n\nI was gonna add some subtitles, detailing what I did, but I got lazy so.. if you really want to know what I'm doing in a certain part, feel free to dm me.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nSqu6nELME?si=4-2c-pHS6XEPE29r\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThrough a few hours of trial and error of using different methods to composite, here is what I ended up with:\n\n![runningDogFinalCompressedGIF.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogFinalCompressedGIF.gif)\n\nHere is the High Res Ver on youtube (Though due to youtube playback and network speed, it may not load as smoothly as a gif.):\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/04N1HEK5PRU?si=CrW_dNedZp-5bpvv\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n---\n\n### Comping Takeaways\n\n1. Try different methods, and eventually you'll find what works for you. It's ok to spend a lot of time on method only to later choose a different method you were considering.\n\n2. If you have different layers of bg in separated clips and you want to move the whole background AND foreground BUT not the character sandwiched between, it appears to be easier to just composite each of the clips separately and then turn them into one composite clip to move them.\n\n3. If rendering or playback is slow, you probably need more ram. \n- Ways you can optimize your playback include:\n    - Go to DaVinci Resolve > Preferences > System > Memory and GPU and increase the memory limit as much as you can. If it is maxed out, nothing you can do there.\n    - Go to Playback > Render Cache > Set it to Smart or User and change Render Cache Fusion Output to On\n    - Try going to Playback > Timeline Proxy Mode > Half Resolution or Quarter Resolution. This makes your playback blurry but it will be fine when rendered.\n\n- Patience is key. If you have done all of the above and it still is laggy, just wait it out. Make yourself a snack or drink or finish some chores while you wait.\n\n- If playback is so laggy that you can't really tell the timing of things, (and this has happened to me before - a long forgotten memory til now...) render it out and watch the animation. \nThen when you go back, try to tweak it based on what you want to see corrected in the render version. Render again, and see how close you are and retweak as needed. Rinse and Repeat.\nWith experience, your tweaks will get more accurate and your compositing will take less time. (Been almost 2 years since I last composited so I totally forgot about this lag.)\n\n4. When trying to make something loop, first, set up the thing that will take the longest to play through. For example I know the clouds are going to move the slowest so everything else will need to LOOP Perfectly within the cloud's loop duration. If anything is off, it will feel choppy. So say you have the cloud down but the dog is off by 2 frames at the end. What you can do is make sure the dog gets the few frames added back AND extend the cloud's loop by just a bit, thus slowing it just down a little bit more - but keeping the balance.\n\n    IMO this is the hardest part about making a looping animation - timing everything so that all the smaller loops - ALL TIMED DIFFERENTLY - fit perfectly within the largest loop, and subsequently making sure the transition is SMOOTH for every single item in the animation.\n\n    Be Patient, this takes a LOT of tweaking and trial and error! But once you get it to loop perfectly it is super satisfying XD\n\n    Repeatedly play the last few frames of the animation and loop around to the beginning, checking everything to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible.\n\n5. IF you can, set up the animation first before compositing otherwise playback will be pretty slow.\n\n6. Instead of using clips and copying and pasting them if they aren't long enough to match the full loop, simply make a fusion clip and drag the small loop in as the media in, connect it to the media out, hit loop and when you go back to Edit, you can make it as long as you need to and it will still loop!!\n\n    HOWEVER - Note that when you make the clip longer than it already is, you may see an error saying no media found. Just go back into the fusion clip, uncheck and RE-check the loop checkbox and go back to Edit and it will show up again. My guess is that either it takes time to sync the loops or it just can't tell that it's been expanded and thus is confused so unchecking and rechecking the loop box basically reorients it.\n\n7. Use markers to mark where something is supposed to happen. For example I used red markers (you can pick any color) to mark when the dog lands so that I can make sure when the whole background does the camera shake, that it doesn't do so off beat and that it is synced properly.\n\n---\n\n### Critique of my own animation:\n\n#### Baked In Comp Version:\n\n![runningdogWithBakedInComp.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningdogWithBakedInComp.gif)\n\n1. Bg is too colorful, dog is too gray, focus is more on bg... But if the bg is too boring, the whole thing looks quite dull cus the dog is already gray..\n\n2. Pretty much everything is timed at the same speed... doesn't look natural. I like each of the elements individually.. but together.. they seem a bit busy - possibly because everything is moving at the same speed so this may not be an issue after Da Vinci Comp is done..\n\n3. Dog could be drawn better...... the conversion from dog legs to block legs look a bit weird but the grass hides it XD\n\n4. The ambient lighting looks alright but there are a few artifacts maybe due to how CSP exports gifs?\n\n5. I personally would rate myself a 5/10 here.. its aight.... meh.\n\n#### Da Vinci Resolve Comp Ver:\n\n![runningDogFinalCompressedGIF.gif](assets/content/RunningDog/img/runningDogFinalCompressedGIF.gif)\n\n1. The cloud could have been connected better on the loop but oh wells..\n\n2. There is a faint horizontal line on the closer mountain.. Couldn't figure out why tho..\n\n3. It was a lot harder to do the camera shake when the dog lands.. I feel like there is a better way of doing this in Da Vinci but I haven't figured out what it is yet..\n\n4. Overall I'm quite satisfied that everything loops quite nicely and pretty much seamlessly!\n\n5. Lighting turned out decent!\n\n---\n\n### Time It Took:\n\nBaked In Comp: Roughly 2-3 weeks (Ranging from 1-3 hours of work on the weekdays and 8-16 hours on the weekends)\n\nExported Then Comp'd: Roughly 3-4 weeks (Ranging from 1-3 hours of work on the weekdays and 8-16 hours on the weekends)\n\nThough it took a bit longer than it would usually take for me also because I was screenshotting and documenting everything.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Resources:\n\nGood Vid on Animating 2D Backgrounds Dynamically: \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7yirNAyD5M?si=kpriD38mOgQhht05\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nDa Vinci Resolve Tutorials (General):\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qDHnCFMZ9HA?si=ezFk65wt16mna2pT\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwg8D0P4z7M?si=Sts6Enp919ZVbnkd\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nDa Vinci Resolve Color Grading/Correction Tuts:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SkosqJfzEs0?si=SKTVA_QGViZUKvGL\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfyriApWIJY?si=xUizx6PIpZDsjjsh\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n---\n\n#### If you read this far, thanks for reading and I hoped it was helpful and hope you enjoyed it! :D\n\n","folderName":"RunningDog"},{"id":6,"title":"Automating Securely with Salt","author":"Mitsuki Youko","date_created":"2026-02-04","tag":"techwriting","blurb":"A starter guide on automating with SaltStack and securely storing passwords through the use of GPG encrypted secrets within Salt Pillars.","content":"\n## Intro\n\nPer Wikipedia, \"Salt or SaltStack is an infrastructure as code software tool for configuration management.\"\n\nIt is similar to Ansible, Puppet, and Chef.\n\nThis guide will cover the basics of installing and configuring the saltmaster, installing the salt-minion to clients, basic salt usage, a short intro to how grains work for targeting different types of machines, briefly covering the built in grains as well as show you how to make custom grains. It will also show you how to install packages with salt, as well as how to use pillars for secrets (such as credentials).\n\nIf you would like to follow along, here's a link to the source code: [https://github.com/mitsukiyouko555/salt-pillar-demo/](https://github.com/mitsukiyouko555/salt-pillar-demo/)\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A linux server of which to install saltmaster on\n- Salt Minon installed on all clients - this can be installed during PXE Boot (in Kickstart) for example..\n- Update /etc/hosts to point to the Salt Master's IP Address - usually done via PXE Boot as well, but in this example, I'll be doing this manually instead, since I don't have PXE boot set up in my lab.\n- Your salt minions and master need to be on the same network so they can communicate with each other.\n\n---\n\n## Installing Saltmaster\n\nNavigate to [https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/) and pick the install option that best fits the machine you want to designate as your salt master.\n\n![salt installation instructions](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/0.png)\n\nMy saltmaster is an Ubuntu 2404 VM server, so I will be following these [instructions](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/topics/install-by-operating-system/linux-deb.html):\n\n\n```\n# Ensure keyrings dir exists\nmkdir -m 755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings\n\n# Download public key\ncurl -fsSL https://packages.broadcom.com/artifactory/api/security/keypair/SaltProjectKey/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/salt-archive-keyring.pgp > /dev/null\n\n# Create apt repo target configuration\ncurl -fsSL https://github.com/saltstack/salt-install-guide/releases/latest/download/salt.sources | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/salt.sources\n\n# Refreshes apt repos\napt update\n\n# Installs Salt Master\napt install salt-master\n```\n\nOnce done, run \"systemctl enable salt-master\" to ensure that the service automatically comes back up even after a reboot, then run \"systemctl status salt-master\" to ensure it is up and running. If it is not running, run \"systemctl start salt-master\" to start it up.\n\nIf all is well, it should look something like this:\n\n![salt master status](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/1.png)\n\n---\n\n## Installing Salt Minion (Manually for Lab purposes) on a Client\n\nMoving on to the Salt Minion(s)... \n\nSalt Minions need 2 things to work properly..\n\n1. It needs the Salt Minion package to be installed (same steps as installing the salt master, except when you get to the part where you run \"apt install salt-master\" (if on debian), you replace that with \"apt install salt-minion\".)\n\n2. It needs to know where the saltmaster is (and what it's called if its under a different name). This can be added to /etc/hosts\n\nIn a some production environments, everything the salt minion needs is configured via PXE boot so that once a PC as been imaged via PXE boot, it will automatically be able to connect to the salt master - after which you can highstate a pc to your desired state.\n\nIn this lab environment, however, as I don't have PXE boot set up, I'll be doing this manually.\n\nAfter following the installation steps as noted above, I then edited the minion's /etc/hosts file to include the ip address of my salt master and the name \"salt\" so that it knows to look for it. If you edited your salt master configurations in /etc/salt/master to be something other than salt, then you would put that in your /etc/hosts.\n\nDo note that that is not the same name as the HOSTNAME of your saltmaster - but rather the name of the saltmaster within the saltmaster \"master\" configurations!\n\nAs you can see here, the HOSTNAME of my saltmaster is \"hydra\" and its ip is 172.16.78.146 - but that does not affect the fact that the salt minion service will refer to 172.16.78.146 as \"salt\" rather than \"hydra\".\n\n![saltmaster ip a](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/2.png)\n\nMy first salt minion is an Ubuntu 2404 VM while my second salt minion is a Kali Linux VM as I've had that VM for the longest time so I figured I'd integrate it into this lab.\n\nThe Kali VM has a better GUI so most of the salt-minion screenshots will be from there.\n\nSo here on the Kali VM, I opened /etc/hosts:\n\n![/etc/hosts](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/3.png)\n\nAnd added the IP address for the saltmaster like so:\n\n![updated /etc/hosts](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/4.png)\n\nOnce that's done, on the salt-minion, run these 3 commands:\n- systemctl enable salt-minion\n- systemctl restart salt-minion\n- systemctl status salt-minion\n\nWhat these commands do is enable the service so if the server reboots, then the service will auto start on its own rather than needing you to start it manually. \n\nSystemctl restart, as the name implies, restarts the service. The reason we do this after adding the saltmaster's ip address to the minion's /etc/hosts is because on some linux distros, it automatically starts the salt-minion service after the installation. So to get it to see the new configs so that it can find the salt master, you would restart the service so that when it comes back up, it sees the new configurations.\n\nIF you get an error on the salt minion, check the following:\n\n1. Is the IP you put in /etc/hosts correct? If not, correct it, then run 'systemctl restart salt-minion', and then run \"systemctl status salt-minion\" and see if it is up.\n2. IF the IP IS correct, then check to make sure that the salt-minion is on the same network as the salt master. If they are on different networks, they won't be able to talk to each other.\n3. Are the salt master and salt minion on the same salt VERSION? (You can check this by running \"salt-master -V\" or \"salt-minion -V\"). If they are NOT on the same version, you will need to uninstall the salt minion, and reinstall the version of the salt minion that matches the salt master. \n\nSay, for example, the latest version is salt 3008, but your salt master is on 3007, and your salt minion keeps pulling the 3008 package because it sees that as the latest one, you will need to pin 3007 using the Salt Installation instructions for your respective OS, and pin it before installing.\n\nExample:\n\nHere, the salt minion is installed but it's showing as inactive (dead).\n\n![salt-minion - inactive](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/5.png)\n\nI checked my /etc/hosts and realized that I had a typo in the ip address for the \"salt\" entry.\n\nAfter I fixed that, I restarted the salt-minion service.. Still, nothing..\n\nThen I checked the network my Kali VM was on compared to the Saltmaster and realized they were on two different networks.\n\nI then switched the Kali VM over to the same network and restarted the salt-minon service again and bam there it is!\n\n##### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce the service is up, go to your saltmaster and run \"salt-key\".\n\nThis will show all the salt minions that attempted to connect to the saltmaster.\n\n![salt-key](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/6.png)\n\nTo accept the minion, run \"salt-key -a \\<minion-name>\"\n\n![add salt minion](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/6-1.png)\n\nTo delete a minion, run \"salt-key -d \\<minion-name>\"\n\n![delete salt minion](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/6-2.png)\n\nIf you ever need to re-register a minion, say if you removed salt-minion to install a different version or if you reimaged the pc and now it's getting re-registered again, you will first need to run \"salt-key -d \\<minion-name>\", then RESTART the SALT-MINION service on the salt minion so that it reaches out to connect to the saltmaster again, then run \"salt-key -a \\<minion-name>\" to properly add it back. If you don't remove it and re-add it back, you may run into issues when you try to run states (state.sls or highstate) against your minion.\n\n![delete and re-add salt minion](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/6-3.png)\n\nOnce you have added it, you can try test the connection between the master and minion by running \"salt '*' test.ping\".\n\nHere, \"*\" refers to \"all\" minions. If you want to target only one minion, you can put the minion's name in between the single quotes, like so \"salt 'kali' test.ping\".\n\nIf you get a response, that means it is good to go - and if you get a \"minion did not return. [Not Connected]\", that means that either the minion is offline or it is not recieving pings OR it could be that there is a mismatch between the salt minion and master versions thus leading them to not be able to talk to each other.\n\n![salt ping](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/7.png)\n\nSometimes, as you work with salt, a minion could have its salt-minon service up but not be returning responses to the saltmaster. In that case, using test.ping can give it a \"kick\" so to speak, and get it talking to the saltmaster again.\n\n![salt ping kick](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/7-1.png)\n\n---\n## Basic Salt Usage\n\nAlright, now that the saltmaster is able to connect to the saltminions, lets talk about how to use salt.\n\nFirst, create  the /srv/salt directory with \"mkdir -p /srv/salt\".\n\nThat is the default path that the salt master looks at to find salt \"states\". (You can change this in the /etc/salt/master configs if you so choose.)\n\nStates are files that contain information on what you want a system to look like, for example, if you want app xyz installed, and certain files configured certain ways.\n\nYou can run states on minions in one of 2 ways - Highstate, or state.sls.\n\nTo understand what these are you'd first need to know what sls's are.\n\n.sls files are state files in that they contain what the *expected* state of the machine should look like.. (For example, VS Code should be installed on it, or nsswitch.conf on the minion should be exactly the same as the nsswitch.conf template on the saltmaster.)\n\nYou could have an sls for adding local users, a different sls for installing all the software that is needed, another sls for configuring certain files, etc.. The possibilities are endless.\n\nHowever, top.sls is a special state file. It is a master document of all the .sls's. It pulls in all other .sls's that needs to be run so nothing gets missed.\n\nThe summarize: \n- The point of a top.sls is to INCLUDE other sls's in it\n- The individual sls's contain the LOGIC used to do what is needed.\n\nSalt .sls files use YAML syntax. This means that the first statement is smack-dab to the left, and substatements of it are indented to the right 2 spaces at a time.\n\n### NOTE: Do NOT use tab to indent - only use spaces 2 at a time.\n\nExample of a Top.sls file:\n\n```\nbase:\n  '*':\n  - installStuff\n  - directory.applesAndOranges\n  - addAdminUser\n\n```\n\nExample of a regular .sls file:\n\n```\ninstallMicro: (Name of the set of commands - optional)\n  pkg.installed: (This command tells the pc to use its native install method to install the noted packages.)\n    - name: micro (This is the name of the package to install)\n```\n\nHere is what it looks like without the comments (see how each nested item is indented by TWO SPACES):\n\n```\ninstallMicro:\n  pkg.installed:\n    - name: micro\n```\n\nThere's a shortnand way to write it too, which is like this:\n\n```\nmicro:\n  pkg.installed\n```\n\nBut issue with that is... you can't include multiple packages in one command.\n\nYou can use the shortand if there is only one package to install but if you have multiple packages to install, you can do so like this:\n\n```\ninstallPkgs:\n  pkg.installed:\n    - pkgs:\n      - package1\n      - package2\n      - package3\n      - package4\n      - and so on\n```\n\nHere is a tree/directory/folder view of what a typical salt directory looks like:\n\n![tree view](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/8.png)\n\nAs you can see, the top.sls file sits at the root of /srv/salt.\n\nThe top.sls consists of a \"base\". \n\nHere, the base target is '*' which means \"all\" minions:\n\n![top.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/9.png)\n\nOther .sls files can either sit beside it or sit within a directory in /srv/salt to be referenced.\n\nAs you can see, installStuff is sitting in the same directory as top.sls so it can be referenced directly, but applesAndOranges.sls is within the directory folder, therefore it is written as directory.applesAndOranges - if you don't include the directory, you'll get an error where it says it can't find the file.\n\nAlso take note that when referencing .sls files, we do NOT include .sls in their name as you can see in that screenshot, but it is expected that they be in the proper directory - ie somewhere within the /srv/salt directory (or whatever directory you designate in /etc/salt/master if you configured it so that it no longer uses the default directories.)\n\nAfter creating the /srv/salt directory, you can start creating sls's.\n\nTo start using top.sls, you first need another .sls in the same root directory as the top.sls so that you can then include it in your top.sls.\n\nThe easiest thing to do for learning and testing purposes, is to create a .sls that installs something.\n\nExample:\n\n![install lolcat](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/10.png)\n\nThen include it into top.sls\n\n![add install.sls to top.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/11.png)\n\nOnce you have a top.sls all set up, to run it, run \"salt '\\<minion>' state.highstate\"\n\nIF you ONLY want to run the individual .sls for testing purposes, instead of running highstate, you'd run it like so: \"salt '\\<minion>' state.sls \\<sls_Name>\".\n\nUsually, if you are running just that one SLS, it'd mostly be for testing.. in which case you'd only want to make sure to run it on your test machine, NOT on '*', unless you've already tested it and intend to make a production change that can be done by running that sls once. \n\nAn example of running ONE .sls on '*' would be to change where an existing NFS mount is pointing (in the event that the source of that mount is to be migrated to another server) - you wouldn't want to put that .sls in top.sls. \n\nInstead, you'd want to edit the original mount .sls so that it points to the new mount for NEW machines for when they get the state applied - but what about the old ones?\n\nObviously, you need to make it so the old ones point to this new mount.. But in that case, you'd only need to run it once for all machines so that all EXISTING machines have their fstab/mounts pointing to that new mount as the new machines are covered by the updated .sls.\n\nSo in that case you'd run your migrateNFS.sls on all existing minions with '*'.\n\nFor testing purposes, however, here's an Example:\n\nIf the state has been applied successfully, you'll see a success message.\n\n![Successful salt run](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/12.png)\n\nSometimes if you have dpkg errors, you have to ssh to the machine and fix the dpkg errors and make sure apt is up and running before running the .sls again.\n\nTIP: If you want to know where in your salt state it's working on when running, you can ssh to the minion and run 'journalctl -f' to follow it as it walks through the commands. You'll see something like this:\n\n![journactl -f](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/13.png)\n\nWhen it's using \"aptpkg\", you'll know that it's installing something. Some linux distros might actually tell you what it's installing while others might not but at least you get a sense of what it's doing in that you know its not updating a config right now, rather, it is in the middle of installing something.\n\nIf you ran it once, and want to run it again, it will turn from blue to green if it is already in the correct state.\n\n![already installed](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/14.png)\n\nTo show you what you can do with file management in Salt, I'll give you another example.\n\nSay you want to copy a file that has certain configurations.. In this simple example, let's say want to put a file in the minion's root directory that says \"I'm an Orange\" when the file is read. \n\nSo to do this, you need a few things:\n1. A file called orange.txt with the text \"I'm an Orange\" that sits somewhere within /srv/salt or one of its subdirectory on the saltmaster\n2. An applesAndOranges.sls (the naming will be explained later but basically you need a .sls to tell salt which file to pick up on the saltmaster and where to put it on the salt-minion)\n3. I'd then need to include the applesAndOranges.sls into top.sls\n\nFirst, create a directory, alongside top.sls. In this example, for simplification purposes, it is called \"directory\".\n\n![directory folder](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/15.png)\n\nThe, create the applesAndOranges.sls file, along with a \"files\" directory.\n\nIn a production environment, many times, sls's that need certain files have the files within a sub directory next to that .sls, albeit with better and more specific naming conventions than just \"files\".\n\n![directory folder](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/16.png)\n\nWithin the files directory, create an oranges.txt file:\n\n![oranges.txt](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/17.png)\n\nWithin the applesAndOranges.sls file, include the following content:\n\n![applesAndOranges.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/18.png)\n\nLet's break this down line by line:\n\n1. copyOranges is the name of this set of commands. You can name this whatever you want but it's better if it is a descriptive name.\n2. file.managed is the actual command. It manages the file and ensures the Minion has the file set up correctly based on the parameters given below.\n3. The name you put is the path you want the file to show up in on the salt minion.\n4. The source = where the file is on the saltmaster. In this case, oranges.txt file is within the \"files\" folder of the \"directory\" folder in the salt root dir. salt:// means the root directory of salt based on the saltmaster configurations. By default, that is /srv/salt. So by typing salt:// you are effectively saying /srv/salt.\n5. User - the owner of the file\n6. Group - the group that owns the file\n7. The permissions for the file. A permission of '0644' means that the owner can read and write while the group and other users can ONLY read the file.\n\nNOTE: See how file.managed is indented by TWO spaces? And then, see how the sub-options for file.managed is indented by 4 SPACES? \n\nIt is critical that you use spaces for indentation and not tabs as salt will definitely complain and throw an error about tabs being used in lieu of spaces.\n\nHere is a visual for those who are more visually inclined:\n\n![applesAndOranges.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/19.png)\n\nNow that the applesAndOranges.sls file has been created, let's test it by running it on ONE minion with this command: \"salt '\\<minion>' state.sls applesAndOranges\"\n\nNote that here, we don't include .sls in the applesAndOranges name because we are already calling state.sls.\n\nIf it is successful, you'll see something like this:\n\n![applesAndOranges.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/20.png)\n\nIf it fails, it could be because you have a syntax error (things aren't indented properly using spaces, no tabs), or it can't find the file so your source path may be wrong, or there could be some typos in the .sls. \n\nHere's an example of a syntax error:\n\n![applesAndOranges.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/20.5.png)\n\nSyntax troubleshooting could be its own wiki, so to remain focused on Basic Salt, I'll refrain from going into detail about that in this wiki.\n\nAssuming it was successful, you can then go to top.sls and add applesAndOranges.sls in there so that when you highstate it, applesAndOranges.sls will be run for sure, among all your other .sls files that you include.\n\nSince you know for sure that this works, you can add it to highstate like so:\n\n![adding applesAndOranges.sls to highstate](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/21.png)\n\nYou can then run highstate on one minion again to see if everything runs properly, and if so, you're good to go!\n\nMoving on, let's talk about how you can use Grains and Jinja to target systems.\n\n---\n### Targeting Systems with Grains and Jinja\n\nFirst, let's go through some definitions:\n\n- Grains - These contain info about a device like OS, Kernel, and a bunch of other stuff like that. This is useful if, say, you want to target only certain OS but not others. However, that's not all. You can set custom grains and target those as well.\n\n- Jinja - Syntax for writing targeted code - usually used with grains - and most popularly used with if/else statements. \nExample: If X os, install package A, else-if Y os install Package B, else install Package C.\n\nLinux distros, for example, comes in different flavor such as Debian, RHEL (Red Hat Linux), etc... where packages and commands are likely to be different. Then of course, you have your Windows vs your Macs, etc. All these systems get packages installed or configurations set in different ways, therefore if you have a wide array of OS types in your fleet of salt minions, utilizing grains and jinja is a must.\n\nFor example, take the Freeipa package (Freeipa is an Authentication software)... The Debian Version of that package is called \"freeipa-client\", while on RHEL, it is called \"ipa-client\" - so here's where Jinja is useful in that you can use it to install different versions of the same package on different distros.\n\nSo if you were to have a sls that installs the package 'freeipa-client', it would run on all Debian minions but fail on a RHEL Minions.\n\nAnother use case would be that different distros could have different configurations for say.. \".ssh\" or \".bashrc\" or different configs for different types of software (like NoMachine, and so on). A Jinja/Grain targeted setup would come into use in these scenarios.\n\nNext, lets proceed with a simple example - the oranges.sls that we had earlier... What if we want our Ubuntu servers to have apples.txt and our Kali (or RHEL or whatever other OS) vms to have oranges.txt, we can easily arrange that with Grains and Jinja.\n\nTo see what existing grains are available, run \"salt '/<minion>' grains.items\".\n\nThis would give you a list of all the grains you can target. If you're on a server where you can't scroll up or down, you can run \"salt '/<minion>' grains.items | less\" or \"salt '/<minion>' grains.items >> grains.txt\" to export the output into the \"grains.txt\" file and read it with \"less grains.txt\" so that you can scroll up and down.\n\n![grains.items](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/24.png)\n\nSay you only want to see one grain category, like the OS for example, you can run \"salt '*' grains.item os\" to see what OS's you have for example.\n\n![grains.item os](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/22.png)\n\nNote that in this case, we are using grains.item NOT grains.itemS, as if you use grains.itemS, it will show ALL grains regardless of what you put after it.\n\nOnce you've decided on what grains to target, you can then include them in your .sls files.\n\nSo let's get right into that with this example...\n\nWithin the /srv/salt/directory/files directory, I created a \"apples.txt\" with the content of \"This is an apple...\"\n\nThen I updated the applesAndOranges.sls file so that it looks like this:\n\n![grains.item os](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/23.png)\n\n- The \"if\" line is saying \"If the os grain is 'Ubuntu' then copy \"/srv/salt/directory/files/apples.txt\" from the saltmaster to /apples.txt on the salt minion\".\n\n- The elif line means \"Else if (or 'otherwise, if' in plain english)\" so \"If the os grain is 'Kali', copy the \"/srv/salt/directory/files/oranges.txt\" from the saltmaster to /oranges.txt on the salt minion.\"\n\n- The \"endif\" statement tells salt that you are done with the if/else statement. If you don't include that, Salt will throw an error when you run the .sls.\n\n- It is important to note that there is a space on BOTH sides between the {%%}. If you get a syntax error, it could potentially because you forgot a space on one side or the other.\n\nIf you want to go through the rabbit hole of Jinja syntax, checkout the official Saltstack Jinja Wiki [here](https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/user-guide/en/latest/topics/jinja.html).\n\nYou can use grains and jinja targeting in top.sls - for example, where some devices will need some of your .sls's but not others, depending on your setup and minion fleet. \n\nIf you have a company with multiple sites across the world, maybe the devices in one country would have some different .sls for the set up in that country compared to a base in a different country - especially if different sysadmins of each site have things set up slightly differently and customized to their site with some overlapping elements integral to the whole company.\n\nMoving on, lets take a look at how to use Pillars for storing secrets in Salt!\n\n---\n### Adding User to Minion with GPG Encrypted Password in Pillar\n\n(introduce the concept of pillars. What is a pillar?)\n\n(make a note about making the /srv/pillar directory)\n(also note how pillars also have their own top.sls which is different from /srv/salt's top.sls but functions similarly with respect to its own surrounding .sls's in the /srv/pillar directory.)\n\nBefore we begin, run \"gpg --version\" and ensure that it is on version 1 like so (this will save you HOURS of troubleshooting!):\n\n![gpg ver](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/25.png)\n\nThis is CRITICAL because, as pointed out in Claus Conrad's [\"Using the GPG renderer to protect Salt pillar items\" Blogpost](https://www.clausconrad.com/blog/using-the-gpg-renderer-to-protect-salt-pillar-items/), GPG Version 2 does NOT work for use with Salt Pillars!\n\n#### Here's a Rough overview of steps:\n\n1. Remove gpg2 install gnupg1\n2. Symlink /gpg1 to gpg\n3. Create the /etc/salt/gpgkeys directory\n4. Generate the gpgkeys - this is the key that will be used to encrypt stuff.\n5. Run the command to encrypt the password AND >> it into the .sls file so that you can simply re-space it - especially if your saltmaster is a device where you cannot copy and paste.\n6. Change the owner to salt:salt and set the permissions for /etc/salt/gpgkeys properly. Too permissive = gpg will complain.\n7. Write the sls that your credentials will go into in /srv/pillar\n8. Create the top.sls for /srv/pillar and add the .sls with the credentials to it. \n9. Use the pillar in one of your /srv/salt's .sls file - ensure you use \"- hash_password: True\" for safety, as there are times if you don't include that it prints the password in plaintext on the job output and is then stored in the job cache which defeats the point of using a pillar in the first place.\n10. Include the .sls file that contains the logic that uses the pillar secrets into srv/salt's top.sls for highstate.\n\n#### Now, onto the details:\n\n1. Remove gpg2 install gnupg1\n\nTo do this run these two commands:\n\n```\napt remove gpg\n\napt install gnupg1\n\n```\n\n2. Symlink /gpg1 to gpg\n\nA symlink is a link that points to a different file so in this case by telling linux that gpg = gpg1, we can type 'gpg' rather than gpg1 when using gpg commands.\n\nTo do this, run:\n\n```\ncd /usr/bin\n\nln -s gpg1 gpg\n\n```\n\n3. Create the /etc/salt/gpgkeys directory\n\nThis directory is for storing gpgkeys and will be the \"home\" of gpg.\n\n```\nmkdir -p /etc/salt/gpgkeys\n\n```\n\n4. Generate the gpgkeys - this is the key that will be used to encrypt stuff.\n\nTo do that, run this command:\n\n```\n# Here, we define /etc/salt/gpgkeys as the home directory for gpg and tells it to generate a key for it.\ngpg --gen-key --homedir /etc/salt/gpgkeys\n\n```\nWhen asked what kind of key you want, Type '1' (for RSA) and press enter\n\n![key type](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/31-1.png)\n\nFor the keysize, leave at default and press enter and type 'Y' when prompted for confirmation.\n\n![confirm](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/31-2.png)\n\nWhen asked for a real name, put something like 'saltmaster' for convenience. The name will be used later when we encrypt the key, so it should be something easy to type and easy to remember - preferably with no spaces.\n\nWhen prompted for an email, you can put something random as it does not seem to affect the decryptability of GPG, then type 'O' when prompted\n\n![user details](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/31-3.png)\n\nWhen asked for a passphrase, leave it blank and press enter twice. This is CRITICAL since Salt won't be able to type in a passphrase as a person would, while decrypting the secrets non-interactively - thus if a password is set here, it will fail when decrypting, as mentioned in Claus Conrad's Blogpost.\n\n![user details](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/31-4.png)\n\nAfter it generates the keys, it'll output something like this:\n\n![user details](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/31-5.png)\n\nOnce you see that, you should be ready to encrypt!\n\n5. Run the command to encrypt the password AND >> it into the .sls file so that you can simply re-space it - especially if your saltmaster is a device where you cannot copy and paste.\n\nTo encrypt, run the following command - BUT keep in mind, this will leave the password in your shell history IF you do NOT put a space BEFORE the echo!\n\nIf you forget the space, run the \"history\" command to find the line of history with the password in plain text and run \"history -d \\<line number>\"\n\n```\necho -n \"yourPasswordHere\" | gpg --homedir /etc/salt/gpgkeys/ --armor --batch --trust-model always --encrypt -r saltmaster >> /srv/pillar/secret.sls\n```\n\nReplace \"yourPasswordHere\" with the password you want to encrypt.\nReplace \"saltmaster\" with the name that you used when you created the gpg user\nReplace /srv/pillar/secret.sls with the name of the .sls you want or you can create it like this and rename the .sls later if you'd like.\n\nOnce you're done, cat the .sls file to ensure that the hash is in there like so:\n\n![user details](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/32.png)\n\n6. Change the owner to salt:salt and set the permissions for /etc/salt/gpgkeys properly. Too permissive = gpg will complain.\n\nWe need to change the owner of the /etc/salt/gpgkeys directory because the saltmaster runs as the salt user. If we leave /etc/salt/gpgkeys as root, then only root can access it.\nWe also need to change the permissions for the folder /etc/salt/gpg to 700 and the contents of /etc/salt/gpg to 600 otherwise GPG may decide not to decrypt due to insecure permissions.\n\nTo do that, run these commands:\n\n```\n# The reason we are using chown -R here is to ensure that all items in the /etc/salt/gpgkeys directory are owned by salt. The -R is recursive which ensures nothing within that directory is missed.\n\nchown -R salt:salt /etc/salt/gpgkeys\n\n# This makes it so that the owner (in this case, salt) has FULL access to the /etc/salt/gpgkeys directory while the group(s) and others users have no access.\n\nchmod 700 /etc/salt/gpgkeys\n\n# This makes it so that the owner (in this case, salt) has ONLY read and write access to the CONTENTS of the /etc/salt/gpgkeys directory while the group(s) and others users have no access.\n\nchmod 600 /etc/salt/gpgkeys/*\n\n```\n\n7. Write the sls that your credentials will go into in /srv/pillar\n\nHere's an example of what that looks like:\n\n![sls with gpg hash](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/27.png)\n\nCRITICAL things to take note of:\n\n- You MUST include a yaml/gpg shebang at the top of the .sls where your hash is stored so that the salt pillar knows to use gpg to decrypt it.\n- Include a '|' after \"password:\" but do NOT add any spaces after the '|'\n- You MUST include 4 spaces, not tabs for EVERY line of the password hash starting from \"BEGIN PGP\" to \"END PGP\"\n\n```\n#!yaml|gpg\n\nadd_admin_user:\n# TWO SPACES for indentation\n  username: adminuser\n  password: |\n# BEGINNING HERE, we have FOUR spaces - again, do NOT use TABs here!\n    -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\n    hQEMAwd3xpOZWIUhAQgAsB16b0Mh8RDGMZjLIbp1sgq7jVUB1pqNKVmusRiruSPT\n    f56PLLQDFAt1UdIpYapS5BmwZFrBw4NbaO4S1FxQyxO1CXz/o8fhDP8kuJLTB98k\n    pXD/W2Mu4LZe01PkuF4FMKggmjiGy4M98heSbezkVK0v2CepOgr4raTp2I6hhqHg\n    tz85RUjaGRAxtk0EOvoinugYoeQom8Im1YHXZ9rzJoa9vkddNyGS1K7PFSFH2sAx\n    tCaKPdoPS9bLlRE6JlEcznO89TziVoAQ/rzU8SSTQ3lXAeilbJtnU4EFoMLcIqdc\n    l8PExvW+zg1aA9h12S2jSt0OnjTeoCfZTNYpd5kvTNJGAXTmxxrpbwxJLIZeheSU\n    XQXAP+fwqdx0LnSolo4VtblBGynhEr/K/e5IpBFObzQJtLwoYtLQ5QtfLB6vnH3c\n    wQZ5Pf+cLg==\n    =YaoR\n    -----END PGP MESSAGE-----\n\n```\n\n8. Create the top.sls for /srv/pillar and add the .sls with the credentials to it. You cannot use the pillar if its not in /srv/pillar's top.sls as it won't be able to find it\n\nThe syntax is the same as /srv/salt's top.sls, except that it's located in /srv/pillar instead.\n\n![/srv/pillar's top.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/28.png)\n\n9. Use the pillar in one of your /srv/salt's .sls file\n\nSample:\n\n![using the pillar in an sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/33.png)\n\nHere, at the top a jinja variable was used to define \"username\" so as to keep things DRY, adhering to the concept of not repeating yourself.\n\nEnsure you use \"- hash_password: True\" for security, as there are times if you don't include that it prints the password in plaintext on the job output and is then stored in the job cache which defeats the point of using a pillar in the first place.\n\n\nThe syntax for the pillar is as follows:\n\n```\n\n{{ pillar['pillar_SLS_File_With_HASH']['SubItem'] }}\n\n```\n\n![using the pillar in an sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/34.png)\n\nNow to test, you can run the .sls against one minion.\n\nIf it's successful, you should see an out put like this:\n\n![successful sls with pillar run](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/35.png)\n\nNote that if you run into an error like \"can't open /etc/salt/gpgkeys/...\", the first thing you should try is to re-run the chown and chmod commands from step 6 again as gpg may have created more files in there that you need to chmod and chown on so that salt can read them.\n\nHere is a sample of the error you may run into:\n\n![gpg ver](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/26.png)\n\nIf you run into a Jinja Variable error, then you either have a typo in your syntax somewhere in /srv/salt's .sls or /srv/pillar's .sls or the pillar credential's .sls was not added to /srv/pillar's top.sls - in any case you'd want to go through the error and figure out where the issue lies.\n\nIn this example, the error was caused by a typo in addSysadminUser.sls - which was fixed after remediating the typo.\n\n![typo error](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/29.png)\n\n10. Include the .sls file that contains the logic that uses the pillar secrets into srv/salt's top.sls for highstate\n\nOnce you've tested the sls on a minion and confirmed that it works as expected, add it to top.sls to be run with highstate and deployed on the rest of your salt minion fleet.\n\n![added to top.sls](assets/content/automatingSecurelyWithSalt/img/30.png)\n\nAnd with that, you have a working Pillar for keeping secrets in Salt!\n\nAs this is the most tech heavy section of this wiki, here is a supplementary video to guide you through all these steps for setting up and using the pillar.\n\n\\<INCLUDE VIDEO HERE!>\n\n---\n## Outro\n\nAs you can see, what we are doing here is just barely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to salt! \n\nDue to the many ways you can configure salt, the world is your oyster - so I highly recommend that you read the official documentation over at [https://docs.saltproject.io/en/3007/contents.html](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/3007/contents.html) to learn more about what salt can do.","folderName":"automatingSecurelyWithSalt"}]
